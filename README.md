# Voca
Voca is a simple programming language, written in Go, which I am currently working on. The purpose of the project is to create a language that's easy to understand and write for a beginner (and I'm mainly learning Go on this project).

**TODO:**
 - [x] Creating and calling functions
 - [x] Parameters in functions
 - [x] A function can return a value
 - [x] Variables  
 - [x] Print() function 
 - [x] If and While
 - [x] Import other files written in Voce
 - [ ] String concatenation
 - [ ] Several simple libraries (e.g., library for advanced math
       functions, etc.)
 - [ ] Possibility to create a GUI

**Meanwhile, the interpreter will execute the code.v program in the folder it is in when it starts, command line execution using arguments will be implemented**
